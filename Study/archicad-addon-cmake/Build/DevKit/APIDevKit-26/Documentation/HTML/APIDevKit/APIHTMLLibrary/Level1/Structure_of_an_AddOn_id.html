    <h1>Structure of an Add-On</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;<br>
    Practically an add-on is a DLL on Windows, or a Mach-O bundle on the Macintosh. When you launch Archicad, it looks for the available add-ons in this order:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It looks for the <strong>Add-Ons</strong> folder in its own home directory (that is, where you have installed it)</li>

        <li>The designated add-ons folder can be changed in the Add-On Manager dialog of Archicad (Options menu / Add-On Manager...). This path is stored into the system registry under the <em>'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Graphisoft\Archicad xxx\Add-On Manager'</em> key on Windows. On Macintosh, you don't have direct access to this information. Next time when you launch the application, the Add-On Manager will enumerate the add-ons from this location.<br>
        Note that until you change the Designated Add-Ons folder from the Add-On Manager dialog, the 'Default Location' key is set to <strong>%DEFAULT%</strong>, which means the <strong>Add-Ons</strong> folder right next to the application. The 'Actual Path' registry entry shows the actual folder where the add-ons are loaded from.</li>

        <li>You can edit the list of loaded add-ons even individually in the Add-On Manager dialog. The full paths of the added, disabled and skipped add-ons are stored in the registry also.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;<br>
    If Archicad finds an Add-Ons folder somewhere, it gathers all the appropriate files from it and from its subfolders. Subfolders on any level are skipped when the name of it begins with the a parentheses '<code>(</code>' character. Add-ons can also be loaded individually in the Add-On Manager (Options/Add-On Manager) in Archicad, which also facilitates enabling and disabling of loaded add-ons. Please note that certain add-ons cannot be unloaded runtime; you'll have to restart Archicad to disable those.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;<br>
    Every file must pass several tests to be considered as a valid Archicad add-on. If the any of the following requirements are not fulfilled the add-on commands will be not mounted into the Archicad.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>&nbsp;<br>
    In order to be able to build an add-on you must fulfill some requirements in the source files too. Also there are requirements how to set up compilation options and linking parameters.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>&nbsp;<br>
    Please choose a different name for your add-on from Graphisoft's own add-ons, because it may cause problems with the GS hotlink process.</p>
