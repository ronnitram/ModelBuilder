    <h1>Release History</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;<br>
    This document gives information on the API Developer Kits released to Archicad. These sections give a complete list of the shipped API Development Kits as well as of the new features implemented in the appropriate maintenance versions.</p>

    <p>If you encounter a new development in the API, which must be used to code your add-on's functionality, you have to be aware that <b>your add-on will not run under specific (usually earlier) releases</b> of the server application. You should check for the release version with the function <code>ACAPI_Environment (<a href="../Functions/APIEnv_ApplicationID.html">APIEnv_ApplicationID</a>, ...)</code> to get the main and release version numbers of the server application.</p>

    <p>Please note, that as a general strategy of Graphisoft, we try to avoid developing new API services in the maintenance releases. Only the absolutely necessary developments are done there, since an add-on must be shipped for a main version of Archicad instead of a specific maintenance release. The functions below are rather bug fixes than new services, as these missing features prevent a full, consistent solution.</p>

    <p>The version numbers of the API reflect the major release and the maintenance release numbers of Archicad.</p>

    <p>From Archicad 10 the version number of the API Development Kit is the same as the corresponding Archicad version.</p>
