    <h1>Required Functions</h1>

    <p><br>
    When you develop your own add-on, you have to link the appropriate API library to your object files. This library basically contains two function sets.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It owns the main initialization and termination points of your DLL/shared library.<br>
        Sets up the communication channels between Archicad and the add-on.<br></li>

        <li>API functions listed in the ACAPinc.h header file. You call these to work on the Archicad database.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are four functions which must be coded in order to be able to link your add-on to the library.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="../Functions/CheckEnvironment.html">CheckEnvironment</a></li>

        <li><a href="../Functions/RegisterInterface.html">RegisterInterface</a></li>

        <li><a href="../Functions/Initialize.html">Initialize</a></li>

        <li><a href="../Functions/FreeData.html">FreeData</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The prototypes of these functions are also listed in the ACAPinc.h header file.</p>

    <p>Most of these functions (except <code>CheckEnvironment</code>) return an error code based on the type definition <code>GSErrCode</code>. The value <code>NoError</code> means that no error occurred, any non-zero value indicates some kind of error.</p>

    <p>It is very important to understand how the above listed 4 functions are called by the server application.</p>

    <p>An add-on is a DLL or shared library which is not loaded into the memory by default. When the user invokes one of the commands of an add-on Archicad loads it into the memory to execute the command. When the add-on has finished its operation Archicad unloads the add-on again (unless certain conditions are met).</p>

    <h3>The CheckEnvironment function</h3>

    <p>The <a href="../Functions/CheckEnvironment.html">CheckEnvironment</a> function is called when the Add-On Manager enumerates the add-ons. The add-on can check the running environment and define its own behavior, for example it can disable itself in the demo version. The add-on is loaded and unloaded during this step, but the <i>Initialize</i> and <i>FreeData</i> functions are not called.</p>

    <p><i>Notes:</i> the following two points may have a serious effect on the startup time of the server application.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>all your global and (non-function) static variables are initialized during this step.</li>

        <li>return the appropriate error code (<code>APIAddon_DontRegister</code>) if you are not running under the desired server application. This informs the AddOnManager to skip the further steps for your add-on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The RegisterInterface function</h3>

    <p>The <a href="../Functions/RegisterInterface.html">RegisterInterface</a> function is called after the enumeration and the dependency check. As such, only those add-ons are called which pass the first step. The add-on should register its menu items and file types, or add toolbox items here. The add-on is loaded and unloaded during this step, but the <i>Initialize</i> and <i>FreeData</i> functions are not called.</p>

    <p><i>Note:</i> all your global and (non-function) static variables are initialized during this step.</p>

    <h3>The Initialize function</h3>

    <p>The <a href="../Functions/Initialize.html">Initialize</a> function is called right after the add-on is loaded into the memory after the previous steps. This is the point where the add-on should initialize itself, and install the callback functions which will be called by the server application.</p>

    <h3>The FreeData function</h3>

    <p>The <a href="../Functions/FreeData.html">FreeData</a> function is called right before the add-on is going to be unloaded. This is the point where the add-on should dispose the objects allocated in the <code>Initialize</code> function. The <code>FreeData</code> function is called in every case, no matter whether the <code>Initialize</code> or any of the callback functions has failed or not.</p>

    <p>Keep your global variables in known state, if it is done you will have no problem to dispose them. Basic initialization and allocation should be done in the <code>Initialize</code> function, and you can done the inverse in the <code>FreeData</code> function.</p>

    <p>Please refer to the document <a href="Control_the_Load_Unload_M_.html">Control the Load/Unload Mechanism</a> to get further details on these functions.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Skeleton of an add-on</h3>

    <p>The minimal source code you have to implement should looks like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <pre><code>
#define ACExtension
#include "ACAPinc.h"

API_AddonType __ACDLL_CALL CheckEnvironment (API_EnvirParams *envirParams)
{
    RSGetIndString (&amp;envirParams-&gt;addOnInfo.name, 32500, 1, ACAPI_GetOwnResModule ());
    RSGetIndString (&amp;envirParams-&gt;addOnInfo.description, 32500, 2, ACAPI_GetOwnResModule ());

    return APIAddon_Normal;
}

GSErrCode __ACDLL_CALL RegisterInterface (void)
{
    return NoError;
}

GSErrCode __ACDLL_CALL Initialize (void)
{
    return NoError;
}

GSErrCode __ACDLL_CALL FreeData (void)
{
    return NoError;
}
</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This skeleton can be compiled, linked and also executed, however it does nothing.</p>
